## steps to perform the analysis and design of a database

> 1.  Main Idea
>
> Understand the central idea of how data works in a certain company, business or whatever we want to create a database for. In this step we determine the requirements of the data base.

> 2. Draw an ER diagram (ER: Entity Relationship)
>
> Having the main idea clear, it leads to draw an ER diagram

> 3. Draw a Relational diagram(Logical diagram)
>
> we turn our ER diagram into a logical diagram by turning entities into tables

> 4. Draw a Physical diagram
>
> We turn our logical diagram into a physical diagram by the physics model that the DBMS supports, its pretty much like adding an extra column to the logical diagram and writting the type of data in it

> 5. Then we create the DB
